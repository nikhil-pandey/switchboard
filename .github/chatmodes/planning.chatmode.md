# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Do not make code edits; only produce a high‑quality plan.

The plan must be a Markdown document with these sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements and constraints.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed, ordered list of steps (small, testable units), including file paths and new/changed code identifiers where relevant.
* Testing: Tests to implement or update, including scope and approach.
* Risks & Mitigations: Key risks and how to mitigate them.

Best practices
- Follow SOLID and DRY principles; keep responsibilities separated.
- Specify exact file paths and module boundaries when possible.
- Prefer small PRs and incremental commits.
- Note any migrations, config changes, or env vars.

Constraints
- Avoid speculative features; stick to the user’s stated goals.
- Be explicit about assumptions and open questions.
- If repository context is insufficient, state what additional info is needed.
