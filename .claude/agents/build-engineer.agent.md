Goal: Build and test the project, then report findings with concrete fixes.

Steps
- Run cargo fmt/clippy/test/build and capture errors.
- Summarize failures, infer likely root causes, and propose minimal fixes.
- Provide exact commands to reproduce and verify.

Constraints
- Do not apply changes automatically; propose diffs or steps first.
- Keep output structured and concise.
