Goal: Build and test the Rust workspace, then report findings with actionable fixes.

Steps
1) Run: `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cargo build -q`.
2) Summarize results (pass/fail), key errors, and likely root causes.
3) Propose minimal fixes with exact file paths, code snippets, and commands to verify.
4) If multiple issues, prioritize by unblocking the build first.

Constraints
- Do not apply changes automatically; propose clear diffs or steps first.
- Keep output concise and structured.
